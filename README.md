<h2><strong>What is Android?</strong></h2>
<a href="https://apkplay.co/">Android</a> is an operating system based on Linux platform, which is designed for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Initially, Android was developed by Android Corporation, with financial backing from Google and later acquired by Google itself in 2005. Android launched in 2007 and established the Open Mobile Device Alliance, which is an association of hardware, software, and telecommunications companies with the goal of promoting open standards for mobile devices.

Android is open source and Google releases the source code under the Apache License. It's open source code with a no-obligation license that allows device developers, carriers, and enthusiast developers to adjust and distribute Android freely. In addition, Android has a large developer community dedicated to writing applications to extend the functionality of the device with a modified Java programming language. These factors helped Android become the most popular smartphone in the world.

<h2><strong>What is APK?</strong></h2>
APK is the acronym for "Android application package", which is a compressed file format like Zip, Rar that you often see. It is based on JAR format and has open wide with the suffix of ".apk." When you want to install some software on Windows, we have to download the file extension ".exe" to proceed to install the software on Android. It also has files installed with the suffix ".apk". In summary, APK is a file that contains the data of an application or a game built for the Android platform.

<h2><strong>OBB file</strong></h2>
The OBB file will also be part of the data of the games that you will have to install on your device. Usually, the games with good graphics and high capacity will need the OBB file. The main reason why having this OBB file is due to the Play Store only allowing the manufacturer to upload APK files at an average level to ensure the performance of the applications. But with the super mobile on you, it will take a few gigabytes of storage, which can be seen by having a few games on the Play Store. Then, when you start the game, you have to accept the download, add hundred more megabytes to the game. To get the OBB file, you have 2 options, of which you download the game you want then on /SDCARD/Android/OBB/ to find the new OBB file you downloaded and copy it to the place you want, or you can download from the sites that offer the games you need. They will also share the files.
